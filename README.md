Requirements
Add the following starter code to the script.js file:
function numberChecking(){
    if(){

    }
}
Within the script.js file, add the following to the numberChecking() function:
The numberChecking() function needs to take in two parameters: number1 and number2.
Write if statements that check for the following:
If number1 is greater than 100, console.log the string "Number 1 has many digits!"
If number1 is less than 0, console.log the string "Number 1 is a negative number"
If number2 is less than 20, console.log the string "Number 2 is not a very high number"
If number2 is greater than 50, console.log the string "Number 2 is a high number"
Hint! You will use 4 if statements. You will not need if else statements as you are checking for 4 different cases of the parameters.

Call the function at the bottom of your file so you can see the console.log running in your console.
Don't forget to call the function including the two parameters defined as numbers
Use the http-server to open your project in the web browser.
Right-click on the webpage and click Inspect and then choose console to see your console.log.
Remember, if you make changes, you may have to do a hard reload of your page because you are using the http-server.
